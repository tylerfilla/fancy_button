# fancy_button (not production-ready)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tylerfilla/fancy_button.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tylerfilla/fancy_button)

A spiffy little button widget for Flutter modeled after Material Design
floating action buttons (FABs).

This software is considered to be at an alpha level of readiness. I have
plenty more things to do (big and small), and I expect the API to go
through at least one more overhaul. Version 1.0.0 will begin stability.

My primary motivations behind making this were
1. to get a better-animated extended FAB (specifically, to animate the
extended/retracted transition) and
2. to get morphed popup menus (where the FAB morphs into a small menu). 

tl;dr I've been working on a closed-source Android app on and off for a
bit among schoolwork and I needed a yak to shave to keep myself sane.
